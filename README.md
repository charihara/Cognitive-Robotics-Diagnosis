# Cognitive-Robotics-Diagnosis
Diagnosis using implicates and implicants

## Project Description
The focus of this project is to explore the benefits of using implicants and implicates in the diagnosis process. Our motivation is centered around the diagnosis of faults in search-and-rescue (SAR) drones.

## Prerequisties
Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

The project also requires the following Python packages:

* pandas
* itertools
* ttg

You can install these packages using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas
pip install itertools
pip install truth-table-generator
```
## Built With
* Python - The programming language used 
* pandas - Data manipulation and analysis library
* itertools - Functions creating iterators for efficient looping
* ttg - Simplifies the process of creating truth tables by providing a convenient interface to define logical expressions and automatically generate corresponding truth tables. With ttg, you can quickly evaluate logical expressions, validate Boolean functions, and analyze logical relationships.
